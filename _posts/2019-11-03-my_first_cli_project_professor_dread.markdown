 I have finished my very first Flatiron project. It is a Ruby Gem entitled ProfessorDread. My gem is based on the [Pokeapi](https://pokeapi.co/) which provides data and information on over 900+ Pokémon. I choose Pokémon because it's one of the things I enjoy most. I've played a majority of all the games and watched most of the shows since I was a kid. When I found out there is an API (application program interface) for it I was excited. Originally I choose the [Swapi](https://swapi.co/) which is based on Star Wars data/info but it wasn't enough information for me. So Pokémon it was for me and ProfessorDread was born.
 I went through a lot of ups and downs during this project, I experienced a tremendous loss. But finishing this project gave me great joy. So my gem as stated is about Pokémon. The user is greeted then is given a list of 300 Pokémon (all of Gen 1 & part Gen 2). The user then types the name of the Pokémon they would like data on. The data returned is height and weight. The user is then asked would you like to know more about selected Pokémon. Depending on what is selected the version, type, abilities, and moves are returned. The user is then asked would they like more data on another Pokémon or they can exit the program. The output for moves and abilities was a bit cluttered at first but it was cleaned up with case statements. Again this project was very hard for me but I'm glad for every step. I look forward to making changes and keeping the gem updated the more I learn.
