A common theme for me in life and my school projects is shoes. As stated previously I LOVE shoes one of my favorite passions in life. So I did an upgrade to my Sinatra app. I made SneakerBox 2.0, a user can add shoes to there closest. As well as make a review on the quality of the purchased shoe. It shows all the different brands for shoes a user has as well. If your opinion on the changes you can edit options as such. I'm sure I will continue to make more changes as I will be using this app for personal use.
