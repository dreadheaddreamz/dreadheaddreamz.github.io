Its been about a month of me being in the Flatiron Software Engineer program. In this short month, I've experienced a lot of different emotions. We've been focused on backend development with Ruby. As amazing as a language that Ruby is, its also very challenging. The few concepts I struggled with most were object relationships as well as the "has many" section. My next major task to complete is a CLI Ruby application. I have a multitude of ideas I would like to do but it seems so daunting. For my biggest struggle has been sitting down starting a lab and my mind going completely blank. To combat this overwhelming feeling I write down everything. From concepts in readings, common tests in TDD ((test-driven development), code examples, as well as vocab. It helps jog my memory and things I've learned. Coding itself no matter the language can be very overwhelming and my biggest tip I can say so far is writing things down. Don't try to remember everything single little thing. Writing is muscle memory so when you come across the topic again you'll think "Oh I've seen this before, its an instance method, etc.".
Though is been very stressful I've enjoyed the process. I've had nights I wanted to give up and wondering if I made the right decision. Wondering if I bit off more than I can chew. Then there are other days where I feel on top of the world and things are coming easy. As stated it's only been a month in the program but I wouldn't trade these emotions or feelings in for anything. I have 9 months left in this program and I'm looking forward to every reading and lab that comes my way. I have rekindled my love for coding.
