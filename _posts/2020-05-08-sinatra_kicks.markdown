With my Sinatra project I choose to use a subject very close to my heart. It is shoes, shoes or kicks can give you a huge confidence boost. They are collector items, stories, and memories. Every shoe I have has some sort of connection or story to me. I can still remember the first shoe as a kid that wanted **BADLY**. I was in second grade and the shoe was the Jordan 13 low Chutney. That was the shoe that introduced me to shoes. I built an application that allows a user to keep track of all their shoes. it keeps track by name, brand, release date, date you got them, and the ever essential hype rating. I have a sizeable sneaker collection I’m always buying shoes so having a place that’s not my closet is refreshing. Each user will be able to login in see their collection, edit/delete shoes from their collection. I have finished in currently but I will probably continue to tweak and add features to it over time. Seeing something I built and can use is amazing to me, I love it.
