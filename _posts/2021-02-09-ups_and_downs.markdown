This was possibly the hardest project thus far for me. I love doing frontend development cause I like design. But I really questioned myself with this project. I questioned my abilities and strengths. But I got it done. I made a simple app that allows an image from the web to be used along with release date, review, and a title. Each game has its own comment section for others to comment on. In the future I will update this project to add login capabilities.  Video games are another passion I have so being able to combine the two has been fun but stressful.
